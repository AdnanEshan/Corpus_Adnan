This contains helper modules used by your main script (claim_date_extractor.py). Typical structure:


utils/
├── extractors.py   # Functions to extract dates from specific sites (AFP, AfricaCheck, generic)
├── parsers.py      # Helper functions for HTML parsing, regex date parsing, fallback methods
└── helpers.py      # Misc reusable functions (e.g., logging setup, URL sanitization)
